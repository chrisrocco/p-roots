POLYNOMIAL ROOTS
========

### Overview
Educational software that teaches you how to factor polynomial roots. 
CS 420 Software Engineering project.

### Goals
1. **Version Control**: Employ traditional branching strategies to working in parallel and avoid conflicts.
2. **Logistics**: The hardest part of any project is often working with people. We will have regularly scheduled meetings at 10am on Mondayâ€™s to coordinate our efforts. We will perform general project assessment
3. **Modular Design**: Divide the application into independent modules which can be developed independently. Collaborators will depend on each module having its own published API.
4. **Disciplined Development Strategy**: We will practice a subtype of agile development which most resembles extreme programming. We will program in pairs, keeping one partner free to keep the project on track, and leave the other entirely focused on the code.
